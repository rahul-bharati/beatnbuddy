# Beat&Buddy (built for Roadtoweb3 hackathon)

This Project is built on top of polygon blockchain to allow creators to upload their music and make it available for other users to listen to. The uploaded music is stored on ipfs storage and then minted to NFTs allowing it to be owned by the creator itself.
I've built it using next.js for front-end and hardhat for smart-contract development.
